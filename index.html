					<h4><a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia - B.A.Sc Engineering Physics</a></h4>
					<p>2019-2024<br>
						Vancouver, BC<br>
						I am a third-year Engineering Physics student with a strong passion for computer science and
						robotics.
						This degree consists of 4 years of academic study terms and 16 months of co-op work experience
						distributed throughout the years.
						Engineering Physics combines a thorough training of software, electrical, and mechanical
						engineering with advanced physics and math in order to prepare us to work with the latest
						technology.
						I chose to focus my studies in computer science and have taken classes in data structures and
						algorithms, machine learning, and microcomputer design.</p>

					<h4><a href="https://www.oxfordproperties.com/">Oxford Properties - Site Reliability Engineer Intern</a></h4>
					Jan 2021 - Apr 2021
					<p>
						At Oxford Properties, I used my knowledge from a software developing viewpoint and applied it in
						a dev-ops setting;
						I was in charge of finding ways to automate redundant tasks, and I got the chance to lead
						knowledge transfer sessions with my team.
						I also learned about IT adminsitration best practices.
						I worked closely with my coworkers and took on projects ranging from solving incidents in the
						Service Desk team to developing scripts in Python and PowerShell to automate IT processes.
						This role gave me experience in working with Azure DevOps, Jira, Active Directory, and Service
						Now.

					<h4><a href=https://www.ubcthunderbots.ca>UBC Thunderbots - Software Developer</a></h4>
					Sep 2020 - Present
					<p>
						I joined UBC Thunderbots because I developed a passion for robotics during my time in
						university.
						Thunderbots is a student-led engineering design team and competes annually in the RoboCup
						Small Size
						League, an international competition.
						I work on the strategy and
						algorithms of the robots, and always find ways to improve the AI.
						Some projects I have worked on include improving the robot simulation interface to be more
						user-friendly, optimizing robot tactics to chip the ball, and implemented code so the robots
						comply with referee commands.

					<h3>Self-Driving Car Simulation</h3>
					<p><i>-- Python, OpenCV, ROS, Tensorflow, Linux --</i></p>
					<p>This project is part of a machine learning course, ENPH 353. The objective was to simulate a self-driving car in ROS Melodic.
						I developed software to follow the road, detect other traffic, and to yield to pedestrians.
						I also trained a convolutional neural network using the Keras framework to detect license plates and read them correctly.

					<h3>NwHacks 2022 - Educational Website</h3>
					<p><i>-- TypeScript, React, Spring Boot, Node.js, MongoDB --</i></p>
					<p>The website is used to create and share interactive lessons for others to learn in any academic
						subject.
						Creators can write lessons using a text editor with full Markdown and Latex support.
						They can also customize their own questions to quiz the learners. I mainly worked on the frontend and created
						over 10 React components, like a multiple choice quiz editor that was be used extensively across the website.</p>

					<h3>Autonomous Soda Can Retrieving Robot</h3>
					<p><i>-- C++, STM32 Bluepill, PlatformIO, Soldering, Oscilloscope --</i></p>
					<p>The robot is the final deliverable of a 4-month project. It drives and follows a tape path, and
						detects and picks up soda cans to drop off vertically in a box. I specifically worked on the
						control software, the driving algorithm, and tuning of the robot arm to achieve 95% grabbing accuracy.
						My team placed 3rd out of 16 teams based on performance.</p>

					<h4><h3>Hiking</h3></h4>
					<p>Being fortunate enough to live in British Columbia, I have developed a love for hiking.
						For me, it's a great way for to sightsee and get some exercise done.
						I try to make time to go explore BC's breathtaking trails yearly. I have done excursions in
						Squamish, Golden Ears, Whistler, and the Juan de Fuca trail, to name a few.</p>

					<h4><h3>Skiing</h3></h4>
					<p>Downhill skiing is always a great experience, whether I go with family or friends. I started skiing when I was 12 and it has stuck with me since then.</p>

					<h4><h3>Music</h3></h4>
					<p>Music has been a big part of my life and it's a hobby I turn to when I need to destress. I learned piano when I
						was young, and I also played trumpet in my school's wind ensemble for 6 years.
						My favourite moments were playing in the BCMEA Honour Wind Ensemble in my grade 12
						year and going on tour with my school band to Havana, Cuba.</p>
