					<h4><a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia - B.A.Sc Engineering Physics</a></h4>
					<p>2019-2024<br>
						Vancouver, BC<br>
						I am a 4th-year Engineering Physics student with a strong passion for computer science and
						robotics.
						This degree consists of 4 years of academic study terms and 16 months of co-op work experience
						distributed throughout the degree.
						Engineering Physics combines a thorough training of software, electrical, and mechanical
						engineering with advanced physics and math in order to prepare us to work with the latest
						technology.
						I chose to focus my studies in software and electrical engineering and have taken classes in data structures and
						algorithms, machine learning, robotics, and microcomputer design.</p>

					Sep 2020 - Present
					<p>
						I joined UBC Thunderbots because I developed a passion for robotics during my time in
						university.
						Thunderbots is a student-led engineering design team and competes annually in the RoboCup
						Small Size
						League, an international competition.
						As a software developer, I has worked on creating a visualizer using PyQt in Python to watch the robot AI play soccer in a simulation,
						and a feature of the robot to make them drive slower when a referee sends a stopping command.

					<h3>Thunderbots Robot Visualizer</h3>
					<p><i>-- Python, C++, PyQt, Bazel, Linux --</i></p>
					<p>I worked on developing a visualizer to simulate robot soccer gameplay. The visualizer was built using PyQt and receives information from the
						backend via protobufs. I worked on the console widget, allowing various types of logging messages to be displayed in real time.
						New features are continuously being added to facilitate the development of new gameplay software and debugging.

					<h3>Self-Driving Car Simulation</h3>
					<p><i>-- Python, OpenCV, ROS, Tensorflow, Linux --</i></p>
					<p>This project is part of a machine learning course, ENPH 353. The objective was to simulate a self-driving car in ROS Melodic.
						I developed software to follow the road, detect other traffic, and to yield to pedestrians.
						I also trained a convolutional neural network using the Keras framework to detect license plates and read them correctly.

						Creators can write lessons using a text editor with full Markdown and Latex support.
						They can also customize their own questions to quiz the learners. I mainly worked on the frontend and created
						over 10 React components, like a multiple choice quiz editor that was be used extensively across the website.</p>

					<p>The robot is the final deliverable of a 4-month project. It drives and follows a tape path, and
						detects and picks up soda cans to drop off vertically in a box. I specifically worked on the
						control software, the driving algorithm, and tuning of the robot arm to achieve 95% grabbing accuracy.
						My team placed 3rd out of 16 teams based on performance.</p>

					<h4><h3>Hiking</h3></h4>
					<p>Being fortunate enough to live in British Columbia, I have developed a love for hiking.
						For me, it's a great way for to sightsee and get some exercise done.
						I try to make time to go explore BC's breathtaking trails yearly. I have done excursions in
						Squamish, Golden Ears, Whistler, and the Juan de Fuca trail, to name a few.</p>

					<h4><h3>Skiing</h3></h4>
					<p>Downhill skiing is always a great experience, whether I go with family or friends. I started skiing when I was 12 and it has stuck with me since then.</p>

					<h4><h3>Music</h3></h4>
					<p>Music has been a big part of my life and it's a hobby I turn to when I need to destress. I learned piano when I
						was young, and I also played trumpet in my school's wind ensemble for 6 years.
						My favourite moments were playing in the BCMEA Honour Wind Ensemble in my grade 12
						year and going on tour with my school band to Havana, Cuba.</p>
